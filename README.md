# Google Maps TZ

The project is a mobile application that allows users to browse and track various types of vehicles. Users can choose between passenger, special, and cargo vehicles using checkboxes. The app offers a switch button to toggle between list view and map view, where all vehicles are displayed on the map.

The application also includes a settings page where users can select their preferred language. Additionally, there is a vehicle detail page that provides more information about a selected vehicle. From this page, users can directly call the driver or send a WhatsApp message. They can also view the driver's location on the map.
